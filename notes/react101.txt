The App function is a react component, and a react component have two jobs:
1. Returns a JSX
2. Handle user events


JSX is a set of instructions that tells react what type of content should be displayed.
1. HTML element
2. User element

  When it is not a DOM element, like in the second case above, the app calls the function definition
  somewhere inside the project structure.


Request flow for react:

          <--- response index.html
